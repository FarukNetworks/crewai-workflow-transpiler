        You have been provided with a comprehensive analysis of a SQL stored procedure that has been decomposed into structured JSON files.
        
        AVAILABLE INFORMATION:
        1. Business rules: {json.dumps(business_rules, indent=2)}
        2. Business functions: {json.dumps(business_functions, indent=2)}
        3. Business processes: {json.dumps(business_processes, indent=2)}
        4. Implementation approach: {json.dumps(implementation_approach, indent=2)}
        5. Out of scope items: {json.dumps(out_of_scope, indent=2)}
        6. Specific considerations: {json.dumps(specific_considerations, indent=2)}
        7. Original SQL stored procedure: {procedure_definition}
        8. Dependencies: {dependencies}
        
        YOUR TASK:
        Create a detailed implementation plan that includes:
        1. A list of all C# files that need to be created, organized in appropriate folders
        2. The purpose and content of each file
        3. The dependencies between files
        4. The order in which files should be implemented
        
        FOLDER STRUCTURE:
        Follow a standard .NET project structure with folders like:
        - Models/ (for entity classes)
        - Repositories/ (for repository interfaces and implementations)
        - Services/ (for service layer classes)
        - Controllers/ (for API controllers)
        - DTOs/ (for data transfer objects)
        - Interfaces/ (for interfaces)
        - Helpers/ (for helper classes)
        
        Focus on creating a clean, maintainable implementation that follows the repository pattern and modern C# practices.

        You have created a detailed implementation plan for the stored procedure {procedure}.
        Now you need to implement each file one by one.
        
        INSTRUCTIONS:
        1. Follow the implementation plan from the previous task
        2. For each file, return ONLY the following format:
           
           FILE: <folder_name>/<file_name>
           ```csharp
           <code>

        3. Return ONLY ONE file at a time
        4. Wait for confirmation before proceeding to the next file
        5. Maintain consistency across all files
        6. Implement the .csproj file last, after all other files are created
        
        IMPORTANT NOTES:
        - Follow modern C# practices (nullable reference types, records where appropriate)
        - Use dependency injection
        - Document the code with XML comments
        - Reference business functions and processes in comments where applicable
        - Ensure 100% feature parity with the original stored procedure
